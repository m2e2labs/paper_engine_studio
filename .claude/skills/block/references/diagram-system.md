# Diagram System

The diagram is one inline `<svg>` between the title block and the explainer. It uses the studio palette, a small fixed vocabulary (cards, arrows, numbered badges, a one-line key), and a shape chosen by block type.

## Table of contents

2. Color roles
3. Building blocks (card, badge, key line, trust boundary)
4. Text rules
5. Shape catalog by block type (with worked examples)
6. Layout checklist

## 1. Scaffold and reusable defs

```
<svg width="100%" viewBox="0 0 592 {{H}}" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" aria-label="{{plain description}}">
<defs>
<marker id="ar" viewBox="0 0 10 10" refX="8" refY="5" markerWidth="6.5" markerHeight="6.5" orient="auto-start-reverse"><path d="M2 1L8 5L2 9" fill="none" stroke="context-stroke" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/></marker>
<filter id="cs" x="-20%" y="-25%" width="140%" height="160%"><feDropShadow dx="0" dy="3" stdDeviation="5" flood-color="#1A1A2E" flood-opacity="0.07"/></filter>
</defs>
... content ...
</svg>
```

- viewBox width is **592** (the page content area at 44px padding). Keep it 592 so the diagram renders 1:1 on the page.
- Height varies by shape: a single row is about 176, a branch or funnel about 200, an attack with a return loop about 232.
- The arrow marker uses `context-stroke`, so an arrow's head matches its line color. Make a line red and its head is red for free.
- One soft shadow filter (`cs`) for all cards.

## 2. Color roles

Two or three accents max, plus neutrals. Every color carries meaning. Don't decorate.

**Always use exactly these hex values, even in a book with its own colours.** A book's
`theme` in `book.json` is applied by the build, which looks for these values and repaints
them, tints included. A colour that is not in this table is left as it is, and will look
wrong in a themed book.

| Role | Use for | Fill | Stroke | Title text | Subtitle text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Neutral | your app/server, structural boxes | `#FFFFFF` | `#E7E9EF` | `#1A1A2E` | `#5B6472` |
| Mechanism (indigo) | the thing being taught (the limiter, HMAC, the tunnel) | `#EEF0FE` | `#D5D8FA` | `#4F46E5` | `#6366F1` |
| Good (teal) | the desired outcome (authentic, passes, success) | `#ECFBF7` | `#CDEFE8` | `#0D9488` | `#5B6472` |
| Threat / bad (red) | the attacker, the rejected or failed outcome | `#FEF1F1` | `#F8D6D6` | `#DC2626` | `#5B6472` |
| Sensitive (amber) | the valuable thing being protected (secrets, money) | `#FFFFFF` or `#FDF6E8` | `#E7E9EF` | `#1A1A2E` | `#B45309` (often mono) |

- **Badges** (step numbers): fill `#6366F1`, white number.
- **Arrows**: neutral slate `#94A3B8`. Make only the **bad** arrow (a leak, a rejection) red `#DC2626`, so a normal-looking flow turns dangerous only at the end.
- **Trust boundary** (a perimeter the attacker is outside of): dashed `#CBD2DC`.

## 3. Building blocks

**Card** (two lines, centered). `x`/`y` is the top-left; `cx` is the horizontal center.
```
<rect x="{{x}}" y="{{y}}" width="150" height="60" rx="13" fill="#FFFFFF" stroke="#E7E9EF" stroke-width="1" filter="url(#cs)"/>
<text x="{{cx}}" y="{{y+25}}" text-anchor="middle" style="font-family:'Space Grotesk',sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;fill:#1A1A2E">{{Title}}</text>
<text x="{{cx}}" y="{{y+43}}" text-anchor="middle" style="font-family:'Inter',sans-serif;font-size:11px;fill:#5B6472">{{subtitle}}</text>
```
Swap fill, stroke, and text colors per role. Use JetBrains Mono for addresses, status codes, and commands (`169.254.169.254`, `200 OK`, `ssh user@host`).

**Numbered badge:**
```
<circle cx="{{x}}" cy="{{y}}" r="11" fill="#6366F1"/>
<text x="{{x}}" y="{{y}}" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central" style="font-family:'Inter',sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:600;fill:#FFFFFF">1</text>
```
Place badges on the arrows (or just above them), one per step. They map to the key line.

**The key line** (one line under the diagram, the steps in words):
```
<text x="296" y="{{H-16}}" text-anchor="middle" style="font-family:'Inter',sans-serif;font-size:12.5px;fill:#5B6472">1 ... · 2 ... · 3 ...</text>
```
Keep it under about 72 characters so it fits 592 wide. Use ` · ` as the separator and `→` sparingly.

**Trust boundary** (perimeter):
```
<rect x="{{x}}" y="{{y}}" width="{{w}}" height="{{h}}" rx="14" fill="none" stroke="#CBD2DC" stroke-width="1" stroke-dasharray="5 5"/>
<text x="{{x+20}}" y="{{y+18}}" style="font-family:'Inter',sans-serif;font-size:11px;fill:#5B6472">Your machine</text>
```

## 4. Text rules

- Every `<text>` carries its own `fill` and `font-family` in an inline `style`. SVG text doesn't inherit the page fonts or colors reliably.
- Card title: Space Grotesk 14 to 15px weight 600. Subtitle: Inter or JetBrains Mono 11px.
- No font below 11px.
- Center two-line card text with the title about 25px below the card top and the subtitle about 43px below.

## 5. Shape catalog by block type

Each shape is a starting point, not a cage. Flex it to the concept.

### Attack → there-and-back across a trust boundary (worked example: SSRF)
- Attacker (red) **outside** a dashed boundary. Inside the boundary sit your app (neutral) and the sensitive target (neutral with an amber mono address).
- Arrow 1 attacker to app (slate), arrow 2 app to target (slate), arrow 3 target back to attacker as a return loop routed **below** the boundary, drawn **red** (the leak).
- Key: `1 attacker sends a URL · 2 your app fetches it · 3 secret keys leak back out`. Height about 232.

### Resilience → happy path plus a drop to the fallback (worked example: rate limiting)
- Linear top row: source (neutral) to mechanism (indigo) to good outcome (teal).
- A vertical drop from the mechanism to the bad or limited outcome (red), e.g. a 429.
- Badges on the three arrows. Height about 200.

### Performance → timeline or before/after (worked example: debouncing)
- A horizontal time axis. Cluster the rapid events as short red ticks, mark a quiet gap with a small amber bracket, fire a single teal dot, arrow into a teal "1 call" card.
- Or two stacked timelines: "without" (many calls) versus "with" (one).
- Height about 176.

### Correctness → recompute-and-compare funnel (worked example: HMAC)
- Two inputs on the left (e.g. message, secret key) funnel into the mechanism (indigo) in the middle, which branches to two outcomes on the right: good (teal) and bad (red).
- Four short diagonal arrows. Badges: inputs, mechanism, the match outcome. Height about 200.

### Auth → handshake / token flow (OAuth, magic links)
- User (neutral) to your app (neutral) to provider (indigo mechanism) and back with a token. Show the redirect or round trip. The secret (the password) never travels. Show what does.

### Async & jobs → producer to queue to worker (Celery, Django-Q2)
- A web request (neutral) drops a job into a queue (indigo) and returns immediately (teal "instant response"). A worker (neutral) pulls from the queue and does the slow work off to the side.

### Tooling & env → isolation box (venv, uv)
- A project (neutral) inside its own dashed box holding its own pinned dependencies, separate from the system. Contrast with a second project that has different versions and doesn't clash.

### Integration → call and callback (webhooks, API, MCP)
- For a webhook: their system (neutral) POSTs an event to your app's URL (indigo arrow), your app verifies and acts. Show the direction is **inbound** to you, which is the thing beginners get wrong.

## 6. Layout checklist (run before presenting)

- viewBox width is 592; nothing is clipped past 0 or 592.
- Cards about 150px wide; gaps leave room for badges (about 70px).
- Every text has explicit fill and font-family; nothing below 11px.
- Two or three accent colors total, each meaningful.
- The key line is under about 72 chars and centered at x=296.
- Arrows neutral slate, except the one "bad" arrow in red.
- Soft shadow on cards via the `cs` filter; no harsh borders.
